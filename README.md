### Installation Instructions

#### Step 1: Satisfy Software Requirements

You need to have VirtualBox, Vagrant, and Landrush installed. See [full tutorial](http://jaswsinc.com/vagrant-ubuntu-lamp/).

```bash
$ brew cask install virtualbox
$ brew cask install vagrant
$ vagrant plugin install landrush
```

You need to install the `ubuntu/vivid64` Box. See [full tutorial](http://jaswsinc.com/vagrant-ubuntu-lamp/).

```bash
$ vagrant box add ubuntu/vivid64
```

#### Step 2: Clone GitHub Repo (Ubuntu LAMP Stack)

```bash
$ mkdir ~/Projects && cd ~/Projects
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jaswsinc/vagrant-ubuntu-lamp
```

_**Note:** If you want a specific branch, be sure to checkout that specific branch. For instance, the `wordpress` branch makes things much easier if you're running WordPress. The `master` branch is a base with just a LAMP stack; i.e., no special considerations for any third-party software. You'll want to read: [BRANCHES.md](BRANCHES.md) for more information._

```bash
$ cd ~/Projects/vagrant-ubuntu-lamp
git checkout wordpress
```

#### Step 3: Vagrant Up!

```bash
$ cd ~/Projects/vagrant-ubuntu-lamp
$ vagrant up # Boot-up the Box with LAMP ready-to-go!
```

#### Step 4: Confirm it is Working!

- Open <http://ubuntu-lamp.vm>. You should see a `phpinfo()` page.
- Open <https://ubuntu-lamp.vm>. You should get an SSL security warning. Please bypass this self-signed certificate warning and proceed. You should again see the `phpinfo()` page. SSL is working as expected!

_**Note:** If you use something other than the `master` branch in this repo, the default hostname will be different. It will include the branch name; e.g., `http://ubuntu-lamp-wordpress.vm` if you are running the `wordpress` branch._

#### Step 5: Add Files to: `~/Projects/vagrant-ubuntu-lamp/htdocs/`

The is the web root. Add your application files. e.g., WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, etc.

#### Step 6: Learn to Use the Tools That I've Bundled

A username/password is required to access each of these tools. It is always the same thing.

- Username: `vagrant` Password: `vagrant`

Available Tools (Using Any of These is Optional):

- <https://ubuntu-lamp.vm/tools/pma> PhpMyAdmin  
  DB name: `vagrant`, DB username: `vagrant`, DB password: `vagrant`
- <https://ubuntu-lamp.vm/tools/opcache> PHP OPCache extension status and management page.
- <https://ubuntu-lamp.vm/tools/php.php> PHP info (i.e., `phpinfo()`) page.
- <https://ubuntu-lamp.vm/tools/php5-fpm-status/> PHP5-FPM status page.
- <https://ubuntu-lamp.vm/tools/apache-status/> Apache status page.
- <https://ubuntu-lamp.vm/tools/apache-info/> Apache info page.

#### Step 7: Tear it Down and Customize

```bash
$ cd ~/Projects/vagrant-ubuntu-lamp
$ vagrant destroy # Tear it down and customize.
```

In the project directory you'll find `bootstrap.bash`. At the top there are some configurable parameters that you can tune-in if you like. You may also want to tweak the `Vagrantfile` for the project; e.g., to change the `config.vm.hostname` or `config.landrush.tld`. Enjoy! <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>

```bash
$ vagrant up # Bring it back up after you are done customizing.
```

### Hostname Tips & Tricks

By default, the hostname will be: `http://ubuntu-lamp.vm`. You can change this by editing `config.vm.hostname` in `Vagrantfile`.

_**Note:** If you use something other than the `master` branch in this repo, the default hostname will be different. It will include the branch name; e.g., `http://ubuntu-lamp-wordpress.vm` if you are running the `wordpress` branch._

**However, you can avoid the extra step associated with the hostname altogether.** Clone this repo into a directory that uses a `.vm` suffix. A quick look at `Vagrantfile` and you'll see that if your directory ends with `.vm` I use the directory basename as the VM hostname. For instance, I could run through the following steps and end up with `http://my.vm` and `https://my.vm` automatically.

```bash
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jaswsinc/vagrant-ubuntu-lamp my.vm
$ cd my.vm && vagrant up # Now visit: `http://my.vm`
```
